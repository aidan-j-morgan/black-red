##### Marxist Localizations
marxist;Marxist;;;;;;;;;x
marxist_DESC;Servants of the ancient enemy of Americanist and Consumerist belief, Marxists follow the teachings of the sage Marx, known variously as Socialism, Communism, and to the Marxists themselves, the Diamat. The most important entry in the Diamat is Capital: a ten-thousand-page tome that Marxist scholars believe details the sins and cosmic transgressions that led to the Event and provides a guide to preventing its second coming.;;;;;;;;x

##### Anarchist Localizations
anarchist;Anarchist;;;;;;;;;x
anarchist_DESC;While also professing to serve the ancient enemy of Old America, Anarchists place less emphasis on the writings of the sage Marx and his disciples—particularly in regards to Marx’s Dictatorship, which is intended to bring about the liberated state known as Revolution. Anarchists believe that the Dictatorship will instead impede the attainment of Revolution and fail to prevent the Event’s second coming. They instead advocate for individual commitment to Praxis and champion self-determination.;;;;;;;;;x

##### New traits
school_hammer;School of the Hammer;;;;;;;;;x
school_hammer_desc;Adherents of the School of the Hammer are characterized by a strong commitment to spreading the Revolution, especially into areas controlled by the Reaction. Favoring a doctrine of harassment and light infantry, the School of the Hammer is as much a military philosophy as a religious one. Those who subscribe to this school favor the teachings of scholars such as Trotsky, Che, and Gonzalo.;;;;;;;;;x
school_sickle;School of the Sickle;;;;;;;;;x
school_sickle_desc;Adherents of the School of the Sickle believe that Marxist realms must primarily be concerned with internal security, and that a house on a weak foundation cannot stand. By purging the forces of Reaction in one’s own realm, the Revolution is safeguarded against those who secretly serve the Enemy. Scholars of this school include Stalin, Castro, and Hoxha.;;;;;;;;;x
school_book;School of the Book;;;;;;;;;x
school_book_desc;Adherents of the School of the Book believe that only by an exact and uncompromising fulfillment of Capital can the Second Event be prevented. Holding that scholars of other Schools of Thought failed in their attempts to prevent the first Event, members of this School emphasize the primacy of the writings of Marx and Engels, largely dismissing other philosophers as warlords and demagogues.;;;;;;;;;x
school_fist;School of the Fist;;;;;;;;;x
school_fist_desc;Adherents of the School of the Fist believe that the Party should, first and foremost, stand in opposition to the hegemony of imperial powers such as the Confederacy, California, and Brazil. Holding that each culture has the right to their own interpretation of Marxist theory, scholars of this School of Thought include Mao, Sankara, and Ho.;;;;;;;;;x
